[mod-setting-description]
agricultural-roboport-enable-quality=When enabled, plants retain quality from seeds and display quality badges. When disabled, all quality tracking is skipped (requires game restart).
agricultural-roboport-max-seeds-per-tick=Maximum number of seed ghosts the roboport will place per tick; lower values reduce CPU spikes but slow initial seeding.
agricultural-roboport-ignore-cliffs=When true, harvesting will ignore cliffs when selecting deconstruction targets.
agricultural-roboport-debug=Enable writing debug logs to `script-output/agricultural-roboport.log` for troubleshooting.
agricultural-roboport-tdm-period=Window (in ticks) over which Time-Division Multiplexing spreads work. Larger values spread work further.
agricultural-roboport-tdm-tick-interval=How often (in ticks) the TDM handler runs; lower values run more frequently.
agricultural-roboport-seed-checks-per-call=How many precomputed seed positions are checked per seeding invocation; lower values reduce per-call CPU.
agricultural-roboport-max-harvest-per-call=Maximum successful deconstruction orders per harvest invocation; keeps deconstruction throughput bounded.
agricultural-roboport-harvest-checks-per-call=Number of harvest grid cells scanned per harvest invocation; increasing speeds coverage at CPU cost.
agricultural-roboport-quality-proc-multiplier=Multiplier for quality mutation chance when harvesting plants. Base chance is 0.5%. Set to 0 to disable mutations, or up to 100 for 50% chance (0.5% × 100). Values above 100 increase chance further.
agricultural-roboport-quality-improvement-chance=Chance (in percent) that a quality mutation will upgrade to the next quality tier instead of downgrading. Default is 10%. Higher quality plants have slightly lower improvement chance.

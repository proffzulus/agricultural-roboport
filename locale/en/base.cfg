name=Agricultural Roboport
description=A specialized roboport that automates crop planting and harvesting. Issues planting requests and marks matured plants for deconstruction within its operation area.
technology=Agricultural Roboport
technology-description=Unlocks agricultural roboports that autonomously supervise crop planting and harvesting operations using construction robots.
circuit-set-filters=Set filters from circuit network
circuit-set-operating-mode=Set operating mode from circuit network
circuit-filter-tooltip=When enabled, seed item signals with value > 0 from the circuit network become filters. Quality is taken from the signal itself. Whitelist/blacklist mode is still controlled manually. Circuit filters override manual filters.
circuit-mode-tooltip=When enabled, operating mode is controlled by the selected circuit signal. Negative value = Harvest only. Zero = Harvest & Seed. Positive value = Seed only.
controlled-mutation-effect=Increases quality improvement chance for harvested plants. Higher plant quality reduces improvement chance. Pollution further reduces improvement chance.
mutation-flying-text=__1__ Mutation __2__%, Improvement __3__%

[vegetation-planner]
name=Vegetation Planner
description=Draw areas to plan vegetation seeding or clear vegetation ghosts. Configure filters to control which plants are seeded.
error-invalid-tool=Vegetation planner is not properly configured.
error-no-positions=Selected area contains no valid positions for seeding.
tech-not-researched=You need to research "Soil Analysis" technology first.
config-title=Vegetation Planner Configuration
force-sparse=Force sparse mode (3-tile grid even with dense seeding enabled)
filter-seeds=Filter seeds:
select-seed=Select Seed
click-to-set=Left-click to set filter, right-click to clear

[technology-description]
agricultural-soil-analysis=Enables planning tool for automated vegetation seeding in selected areas. Works with construction robots to place seed ghosts.
agricultural-controlled-mutations=Enables quality mutation control for harvested plants. Provides a base chance for quality improvements, decaying by 20% for each subsequent quality level. Pollution further reduces improvement chance, while increasing mutation chance.

[mod-setting-description]
agricultural-roboport-enable-quality=When enabled, plants retain quality from seeds and display quality badges. When disabled, all quality tracking is skipped (requires game restart).
agricultural-roboport-dense-seeding=When enabled, virtual seed ghosts use actual plant collision boxes and seeds are placed on every tile instead of every 3 tiles. Creates denser forests and requires more construction bots (requires game restart).
agricultural-roboport-max-seeds-per-tick=Maximum number of seed ghosts the roboport will place per tick; lower values reduce CPU spikes but slow initial seeding.
agricultural-roboport-ignore-cliffs=When true, harvesting will ignore cliffs when selecting deconstruction targets.
agricultural-roboport-debug=Enable writing debug logs to `script-output/agricultural-roboport.log` for troubleshooting.
agricultural-roboport-mutation-visualization=Show floating text when plants mutate quality during harvest. Displays improvement/degradation with colored arrows.
agricultural-roboport-tdm-period=Window (in ticks) over which Time-Division Multiplexing spreads work. Larger values spread work further.
agricultural-roboport-tdm-tick-interval=How often (in ticks) the TDM handler runs; lower values run more frequently.
agricultural-roboport-seed-checks-per-call=How many precomputed seed positions are checked per seeding invocation; lower values reduce per-call CPU.
agricultural-roboport-max-harvest-per-call=Maximum successful deconstruction orders per harvest invocation; keeps deconstruction throughput bounded.
agricultural-roboport-harvest-checks-per-call=Number of harvest grid cells scanned per harvest invocation; increasing speeds coverage at CPU cost.
agricultural-roboport-quality-improvement-chance=Chance (in percent) that a quality mutation will upgrade to the next quality tier instead of downgrading. Default is 10%. Higher quality plants have slightly lower improvement chance.

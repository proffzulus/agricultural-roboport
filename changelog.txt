Version: 1.2.1
Date: 2025-12-10
  Changes:
    - Automatic detection of ALL seed items - no configuration needed
    - Removed 'agricultural-roboport-additional-seeds' startup setting (no longer necessary)
    - Prototype scanning now checks every data.raw category for items with plant_result
    - Supports any modded agricultural item regardless of naming convention or item category
  Info:
    - No user action required - mod automatically detects all seeds

    - Better mod compatibility - works with any mod adding plantable items

Version: 1.3.7
Date: 2026-02-09
  Major Features:
    - Added circuit network support for Agricultural Roboports
    - Operating mode can now be controlled by circuit signals (negative = harvest only, zero = both, positive = seed only)
    - Filters can be set from circuit signals - seed items with value > 0 become filters, quality is read from the signal
    - UI displays circuit-controlled values in real-time and disables manual controls when circuit takes over
  Improvements:
    - Circuit settings are preserved when copying/pasting, blueprinting, or when entities are destroyed and revived
    - Added translations for circuit network features in all supported languages
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed settings being lost when destroyed roboports are auto-ghosted and later revived

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Date: 2025-12-23
  Improvements:
    - Added entity and technology descriptions for Agricultural Roboport
    - Updated dense seeding descriptions to remove outdated performance warnings
    - Virtual seed entities are now hidden from Factoriopedia

Version: 1.3.1
Date: 2025-12-21
  Mod Compatibility:
    - Added support for Lignumis mod - unlocks Vegetation Planner early
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.3.0
Date: 2025-12-18
  Major Features:
    - Added Vegetation Planner - a manual selection tool for planning vegetation in specific areas
    - Accessible via shortcut bar or ALT+V hotkey after researching "Soil Analysis" technology
    - Independent filter configuration separate from roboport settings
    - Alt-select to clear vegetation ghosts from selected areas
  Improvements:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.2.3
Date: 2025-12-16
  Performance:
    - Significantly improved seeding performance by pre-computing seed metadata once instead of on every tile check
    - Surface compatibility now checked once per seed type instead of repeatedly for each position
    - Collision check budget now properly accounts for wiggle attempts (prevents performance spikes in dense mode)
    - Optimized plant size sorting to use cached data instead of repeated prototype lookups
  Improvements:
    - Filter dropdowns now intelligently show only planet-compatible seeds (e.g., Gleba plants only appear on Gleba)
    - Quality seeds now require explicit whitelist configuration - unfiltered mode uses normal quality only
  Changes:
    - Dense mode seeding is now more CPU-friendly with proper collision check budgeting
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.2.2
Date: 2025-12-15
  Major Features:
    - Added startup setting 'Seed in dense grid' for planting seeds on every tile instead of every 3rd tile
    - Dense mode enables much tighter plant packing for higher crop density
    - Added 'agro-seed-info' console command to inspect plant properties (collision boxes, tile requirements, etc.)
  Changes:
    - Dense mode requires game restart to take effect (startup setting)
    - Performance impact: Dense seeding increases collision checks - use whitelist filters to limit load
  Info:
    - Dense mode recommended only with whitelist filters to control which plants are seeded
    - See mod description for performance tuning guidance
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.2.1
Date: 2025-12-10

    - Removed 'agricultural-roboport-additional-seeds' startup setting (no longer necessary)
    - Prototype scanning now checks every data.raw category for items with plant_result
    - Supports any modded agricultural item regardless of naming convention or item category
  Info:
    - No user action required - mod automatically detects all seeds
    - Existing saves will work seamlessly (virtual seed info rebuilds automatically)
    - Better mod compatibility - works with any mod adding plantable items
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.2.0
Date: 2025-12-09
  Major Features:
    - Added support for non-standard seed items from other mods (e.g., boompuff-spore from Boompuff Agriculture)
    - Added startup setting 'agricultural-roboport-additional-seeds' to specify custom seed items by name
    - Virtual seed entities now created for items with plant_result in multiple categories (item, capsule, ammo, tool)
    - Custom seeds automatically appear in filter dropdowns and work with all roboport features
  Changes:
    - Blacklist filter mode now works at item level (quality-agnostic) - blocking an item blocks all qualities
    - Whitelist filter mode continues to support per-quality filtering
    - UI dynamically switches between item and item-with-quality selectors based on filter mode
    - Virtual seed info now rebuilt on every game load and mod configuration change for consistency
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed filter UI crashes when switching between whitelist and blacklist modes
    - Fixed seeding logic to use prototype introspection instead of string pattern matching
    - Fixed virtual seed info indexing to use actual seed item names
